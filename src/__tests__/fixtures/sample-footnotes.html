But the timing is significant for John in terms of the light-darkness motif—compare <data ref="Bible:Jn 9:4">John 9:4</data>; <data ref="Bible:Jn 11:10">11:10</data>; <data ref="Bible:Jn 13:30">13:30</data> (especially), <data ref="Bible:Jn 19:39">19:39</data>, and <data ref="Bible:Jn 21:3">21:3</data>. Out of the darkness of his life and religiosity Nicodemus came to the Light of the world. The author probably had multiple meanings or associations in mind here, as is often the case.</p></div><div class="note"><sup><span class="noteNoteSuper" id="note_5">5</span>&nbsp;</sup><span class="notetype">sn</span>  The reference to <i>signs</i> (<span class="greek">σημεῖα</span>, <span class="translit">sēmeia</span>) forms a link with <data ref="Bible:Jn 2:23-25">John 2:23-25</data>. Those people in Jerusalem believed in Jesus because of the signs he had performed. Nicodemus had apparently seen them too. But for Nicodemus all the signs meant is that Jesus was a great teacher sent from God. His approach to Jesus was well-intentioned but theologically inadequate; he had failed to grasp the messianic implications of the miraculous signs.</div><div class="note"><sup><span class="noteNoteSuper" id="note_6">6</span>&nbsp;</sup><span class="notetype">tn</span>  <i>Grk</i> "answered and said to him."</div><div class="note"><sup><span class="noteNoteSuper" id="note_7">7</span>&nbsp;</sup><span class="notetype">tn</span>  <i>Grk</i> "Truly, truly, I say to you."</div><div class="note"><sup><span class="noteNoteSuper" id="note_8">8</span>&nbsp;</sup><span class="notetype">sn</span>  Or <i>born again</i>. The Greek word <span class="greek">ἄνωθεν</span> (<span class="translit">anōthen</span>) can mean both "again" and "from above," giving rise to Nicodemus' misunderstanding about a second physical birth (v. <data ref="Bible:Jn 3:4">4</data>).</div><div class="note"><sup><span class="noteNoteSuper" id="note_9">9</span>&nbsp;</sup><span class="notetype">tn</span>  The word <span class="greek">πνεύματος</span> (<span class="translit">pneumatos</span>) is ambiguous, since it can mean either "wind" or "spirit."</div>
